INTRODUCTION 
For our class Project we propose to make an Application to track iium bus location. Via this app student could see where are the busses around. For to make this app we have to use Geolocation Api, We have to setup database for the bus to show only the busses location in the app or we can add IIUM bus driver device location to track the bus.

Problem Statement 
As far we know there is no App in iium student to track iium bus location.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE 
At the end of the project we will try to make a full functional project to show iium bus real location for iium studens
  
Targeted User
Trget users of this app would be all the students in iium community who uses bus as there main source of transportation to attend their class regularly.
 
Specific Platform
React Native Framework, Google firebass, Geolocation Api etc.

CONSTRAINTS 
As a novice developer in react native we think time and and dedication to complete this project would be our main constarint.
   
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT 
Students in iium dont have to waste time sitting in the bus stop waiting for the bus. Moreover, they are late for the class many times while waiting for the bus, by using this app if they can see if there is no bus avilable around they can use an alternate way to go to class on time. Many students sit around 30-40 minutes in a bus stop waiting for the next bus not knoeing when it will come.
 
SUMMARY
We will make an App to track iium bus location for those student who uses bus as there main transportation to go class.
