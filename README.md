INTRODUCTION 

We are developing an Application to manage inventory for superstore, grocerry, shop etc by an admin. Via this app admin of an inventory can see products available. Update product list, add product and delete also. To gain access for the inventory to check and change admin has to go through Biometric login process. In this app we use fingerprint for biometric. We will use firebase real time databse to manage the inventory. Any update or change of the inventory will change the database record immediatly. Admin will be able to add product with details like product name, category, date, quantity etc. Admin can just simply update necessary product using simple mobile app.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE 

At the end of the project we will try to make a full functional App for admin panel to manage inventory.

Targeted User

Trget users of this apps are the admins' who are responsible to manage inventory records for inventory or wearhouse. Using this app they can cut off the aditional paper base record system or adding products to inventory dealing real databases. 
 
SPECIFIC PLATFORM

React Native Framework, Google firebass to setup the database, expo toolchain as emulator, LocalAuthentication Expo SDK API for biometric sign in, react-native-router-flux for routing our apps screens and simulating them, react-native-element for designing the UI.

Specifications
Steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local computer.

8. Install EXPO app from play store in your mobile device. 
9. Run expo start to start the packager.


CONSTRAINTS 

As a novice developer in react native we think time and and dedication to complete this project would be our main constarint. Synchronising our apps funtions is the toughest part of our project according to our knowledge. connecting databases to our screens for data update, processing biometric access then managing the inventory, these sinchronization would be very difficult as novice react native app developer. Getting tutorial resorces, appropriate for our project apply the resources to develop our project is another challenge for us.
